 # Problem 
 1- CeFi platforms, including FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, and others, experienced catastrophic failures in 2022, leading to bankruptcy and significant losses for both ordinary individuals and professional investors such as hedge funds and asset managers.

These failures exposed the lack of credibility in centralized finance (CeFi) platforms, as they failed to provide transparent and secure investment management capabilities.

Issues such as co-mingling of customer funds, engaging in extreme rehypothecation, inadequate risk management practices, and occasional instances of fraud were prevalent among CeFi platforms, further eroding trust and credibility.

2-Despite its potential benefits, DeFi presents challenges even for professional investors.
DeFi offers transparency and immutability, providing clients with continuous visibility into their funds and enabling self-custody and programmable interactions for ultimate ownership.
While more financial institutions, ranging from smaller firms to major conglomerates, are adopting DeFi, they are discovering its inherent complexity.
Effectively utilizing DeFi requires extensive technical capabilities and dedicated efforts to manage multiple ecosystems, protocols, and interactions.
The fragmented nature of DeFi makes it increasingly challenging to develop comprehensive strategies across various protocols without a team of smart contract engineers.
Consequently, getting started in DeFi demands substantial time and investment, creating barriers to entry for investors.

3-Launching new funds or structured products involves a complex, lengthy, and expensive process.
The current approach requires engaging multiple intermediaries, contributing to high costs and time-consuming procedures.
Fund managers must make various choices, including selecting a digital asset custodian for safekeeping cryptocurrencies, an execution management system for trading, an institutional wallet to access DeFi opportunities, and a team of smart contract engineers to execute complex strategies.
Additionally, they need a fund distributor and transfer agent to manage client registration, onboarding processes (including KYC/AML), and subscription/redemption activities.
Other essential components include a fund administrator to track Net Asset Value (NAV), manage expenses, and calculate performance fees, as well as a reporting system to generate regulatory-compliant legal documents.
The multitude of service providers and dependencies in this process creates substantial barriers to entry, particularly for smaller fund managers, even if their investment strategies are superior.
